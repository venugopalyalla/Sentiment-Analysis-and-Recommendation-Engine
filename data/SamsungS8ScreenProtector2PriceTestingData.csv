This was a waste of money for the S8. It totally Useless! Doesnt stick to the phone., 0
This was a waste of money. DOES NOT RESPOND TO YOUR TOUCH! Save your money., 0
This was one of 3 screen protectors available at BB for a S8. It seemed to be the strongest/durable of the 3. I paid so much money for something that does not even work! It smudges like crazy not to mention it does not cover the curved section of the screen fully. It makes it harder to use the phone because it interferes with the touch screen. I placed it on my S8 this morning and I hate that it is making me hate using my phone. I hate this product so much I dug through the trash to get back the return label. It was a complete waste of money. The screen protector that came with the phone is so much better., 0
The shield made it difficult to use the edge features of the phone. It also had a permanent gap that trapped air between the screen and protector. This gave a distorted effect to the screen. Finally it fell off and broke., 0
This glass shield is too thick and comprised the sensitivity of the phones touch screen. Would not recommend at all and is over priced. Best Buy will not let you return or exchange this item. Buyer beware., 0
Dont waste your money even the geek squad guy who installed it couldnt get it to stick completely. It got so bad after a week that I used the free replacement warranty that cost me 11.99 to have shipped to me and put it on myself. It has only been a couple of weeks and it is peeling off top and bottom. Dont waste your!!, 0
Cracked after a couple of days. For something that cost $45 it should have lasted longer. I didnt even drop it. It cracked while in my purse., 0
The screen protector was clear and easily installed but the screen sensitivity was lost all together. There were times that I couldnt get my phone to do anything. Had to press the screen so hard that I was afraid I was gonna break it. Have recently bought another Zagg screen protector for my s8 and love it., 0
Horrible product. Zagg only put adhesive around the edge and not in the middle. The glass always has a bubble and slides. I would not waste my money., 0
This product is not worth the money. It does not work at all. You cannot even use the phone with the screen on. The only way to get the phone to work is by pressing down on the screen with more force than should be needed., 0
Horrible product. Waste of money. Affects touch screen ability. Have to press way to hard to get response., 0
Within 2 days the screen protector lost its adhesive and fell off. I also did not like that I had to press extremely hard on the screen just for touch to register. I am very disappointed in the product especially for the price. Its definitely not worth it!, 0
I purchased this item along with a new phone 16 days ago and it has already cracked. I have not dropped it or abused it. I have no idea how it got damaged or whether there is a flaw in the product. But for the price $30 I would expect it to last more than 16 days. Save your money and dont buy this product., 0
After reading initial reviews I was skeptical about purchasing this screen protector. I spoke with a sales rep in store(she also installed) and she assured me that the glass protector was the best for protection for my phone. Two weeks later I now have a crack in my screen protector that didnt come from a drop. My first time purchasing a glass cover and probably will be my last. Very disappointed in this product for the amount of money I paid., 0
 Cracks spidered and less than a week after I purchased my husband and Is screen protector I had to use my warranty and get sent a new one for the low price of 9, 1
 The BB employee took screen cover off and put a diff model screen on at no cost and also gave me the cash difference back as the glass case cost more, 1
The idea of free replacement was great until I needed to make a claim and found out that it costs $10 for shipping! I was able to buy a different glass protector for cheaper with better touch sensitivity from Amazon\\r\\nI bought it thinking it would be a good product since it was so pricey\\r\\n It did cost $10 For shipping and handling\\r\\nI hope Best Buy allows me to return this it is terrible and I would avoid at all costs\\r\\n Great product for the price\\r\\n Only drawback is the price\\r\\n Over priced and useless\\r\\nThis glass cost $50 and doesnt fit the entire screen, 1
It makes it extremely difficult to use and is overpriced, 1
Glass protector got dusty on it to easy and the dusty would stay trapped on there fell off way to easy and very price0, 1
 I am thankful I got rid of it definitely a disappointment for the price as well, 1
 The cost is a little high for what it is though, 1
 But for the price $30 I would expect it to last more than 16 days, 1
 It does not seem better than competing products considering the price, 1
 They say this just 1st iteration still cost me $50!"0, 1
 I do notice that on the curved sides of the phone I have to press a little harder on the screen than on the middle but if the phone screen is protected that is a small price to pay, 1
cost was affordable\\r\\n But that protection comes at a price\\r\\n The price is that texting became extremely difficult\\r\\n Although it is a little pricey\\r\\n Much better and it costs half as much\\r\\n For something that cost $45 it should have lasted longer\\r\\nFor the price of this i thought I would be great\\r\\nOverpriced  can not press hard enough for some of the buttons  can not pull down menu from top of screen  always skipping letters when typing because of pressure needed , 1
Too annoying for this price"0, 1
