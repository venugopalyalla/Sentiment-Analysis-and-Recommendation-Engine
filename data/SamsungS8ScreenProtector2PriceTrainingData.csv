For the Samsung Galaxy S8 a screen protector is advisable since it is an expensive phone. Glass is easier to keep clean than plastic. Zagg has a Curved Glass Protector that is perfect and it has a life long warranty. Be sure to buy the Curved protector. The rectangular one prevents you from texting accurately since finger strokes must be firm rather that a touch on the screen., 0
I purchased this for my new s8 at launch and it made the screen response to touch so frustrating. It would barely sense any touch unless u press extremely hard. I must say after a few days it drove me crazy brought to go to best buy at lunch. The BB employee took screen cover off and put a diff model screen on at no cost and also gave me the cash difference back as the glass case cost more. Nicely done!!!, 0
I order 2 of theses screen protectors. The first one never stayed on at all even though it was installed like the directions said. The second one I had put on at Best Buy by one of the Geek Squad associates and it only stayed on 2 days before it popped right off. I ended up ordering a completely different case since I wasnt going to keep messing with this protector and having to go back to the store. Also these protectors are kind off pricey., 0
Im sure it offers protection but am unhappy with the touch sensitivity of the phone itself now. Parts of the screen do not fit flat to the screen and sensitivity is very low. Once when it was hot and humid outside the screen was blurred every time I put my finger on the screen. Not happy. considering removing it but hate to waste the money - although right now Im not enjoying my phone either., 0
As others have stated this glass protector makes the device unresponsive to touch feedback. I can tap my screen harder and harder and it still will not respond until I physically apply pressure to the screen. This is very low quality and should be pulled from all stores immediately. I hope Best Buy allows me to return this it is terrible and I would avoid at all costs. (this is coming from someone who is not tough on reviews its just that bad when it comes to this glass screen.......), 0
This glass is so thick that you have to press extremely hard to get any responses. Trying to text dial or just move page to page will have you ready to rip this expensive add-on right off your phone. I left it on for 4 days before I went back and got the normal film. Save your money. Not worth the headache. Only reason for 2 stars is I have no doubt this glass would protect against scratches since it protected my phone from being fast and useful., 0
Installed following directions exactly. Went on easy with no air pockets. Was very pleased until it fell off after only a week. Im a responsible adult no hard on equipment. Expected more for the price., 0
the most awful item made for S8. this is a piece of junk. after putting this I could not type anything. I had to take it off and a complete waste of money. lost $30 and did not get them back. do NOT buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!, 0
The glass screen protector seems extremely and durable. Im certain that it would provide satisfactory screen protection. But that protection comes at a price. The price is that texting became extremely difficult. The user must REALLY tap the screen very hard to penetrate the glass protector and activate the touch screen. I gave up and returned the protector., 0
I purchased thinking that this would protect my phone. The main screen does work ok though it needs a bit more pressure. The pull down notification bar does not work. The top of the screen cover must be right where the notification bar pulls down and I cannot access it to get my notifications settings etc. Going to return it as soon as I can. Very disappointing for the high price., 0
This item prevented the phone user from an acceptable user interface with the phone. Actually had to press down hard to operate the touchscreen. Then it just came off and there wasnt any possibility of reattaching it. There was no stickyness on it. Waste of money. And we paid to have a Best Buy specialist put it on the phone. Double waste., 0
Ive used this product for my galaxy 6 and it was great. Now got it for my galaxy s8 and it is horrible. The screen does not stay on the phone. You loss the touch sensitivity especially the closer you get to the side. Finally its nearly impossible to drag down the screen to see your notifications. This is a complete waste of money. To add insult to injury best buy will not let you return it once the box is open., 0
I am a HUGE Zagg fan. I have used them for years and they have saved many of my devices from damage. The combination of Zagg shields and Otterboxes have been fantastic for me. This is the first time I have purchased one where I havent been 100% satisfied. First the good - the installation process for this version is much better than in previous Zagg glass purchases (Had it for my S5). The installation tray makes it super easy to install the shield perfectly aligned. Once on you can definitely tell that there is a screen protector on although visually it doesnt impact the screen. The bad is that it totally screws up the touch sensitivity. You must press much harder on the screen and frequently you will miss keys when typing or swyping. Pulling down the status bar from the top is almost virtually impossible the first time and typically will take me several tries and sometimes must use two hands in order to pull down the status bar to turn WiFi on or off change to vibrate mode etc. Lastly the Shield cracked VERY easily. Within a week. Now it is possible that this saved my phone from damage but I really havent dropped the phone that hard so to me was a bit premature. They will replace for free but even the cost of that has gone up. Used to be when I purchased my first Zagg shield that replacements were free no shipping and handling. Then it was a small S&H (like $2 or $3). Now it is a $10 S&H fee to replace the shields. A bit excessive...        All in all wish I had saved my money and purchased the regular Zagg shield HD and not paid extra for the glass version. Just not up to snuff for Zagg., 0
I never spend much money when it comes to buying screen protectors. However I got a new Galaxy S8+ and wanted to make it last. I spent the $49.99 on this screen protector plus the $7.99 installation fee at Best Buy to ensure my phone was protected- this was 08/02/17. It fell from a table onto my bag last week and the whole screen protector popped right off (So what? Its been barely 2 months Ive had this?). Luckily my phone was not damaged- probably more so because it is in an Otter Box. But Im not happy that I spent so much money for a piece of glass that is just going to pop off. Its not like it took a hard fall. Ironically when I sat down at my computer today to order a replacement my phone fell again and guess what... The screen protector popped off. If it werent for the replacement warranty I definitely wouldnt be using the same screen protector again... But now that I see shipping is $9.99 for the replacement making my total investment into this thing nearly $70 Im considering researching my other options and investing in something that will actually protect my phone in the event that my phone were to take a fall that required glass protection., 0
I always buy Invisible Shield products and have trusted them for years. This screen protector was a definite disappointment. The protector does not adhere to the entire screen. There is a thin (and VERY visible adhesive line that distracts from the phones aesthetic). It peeled off easily and was the only thing holding it on to the phone. Also even when applied to the phone the functionality was aweful. You had to press very hard onto the screen to get it to scroll if you could even get it to scroll at all with the protector on it. Only the bottom buttons seemed to have responded to touch. I thankfully convinced BB to let me return this item as normally they wont when a product comes with a lifetime warranty. I am thankful I got rid of it definitely a disappointment for the price as well. This is the only time I have had an issue with Zagg products., 0
This product is absolute garbage. Fortunately I have not dropped my phone and experienced the screen protector breaking or falling off but I can HARDLY use my brand new phone. I literally have to push as hard as I can to do ANYTHING on my phone with this screen protector. It is near impossible to text search on the internet or do anything that involves pressing the screen. If you need to press anything near the curvy edges - FORGET IT! It takes me a good 10 to 15 presses to drag the top bar down. Texting has become a joke. I just tried to go into my email account to delete emails and I gave up because I would press an email 20 plus times and NOTHING. I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone. I should have listened to my co-workers advice not to get this product (I forgot at the time of purchase). This was a complete WASTE of money. Now I have to peel it off and toss it in the garbage just a week after purchase just to be able to use my new phone. Very disappointed., 0
Overall I have had good luck with the Zagg products. I think the curved glass protector is a little pricey but it seems substantial. The biggest downside other than the cost seems to be a loss of screen sensitivity that can be frustrating at times., 0
This glass cost $50 and doesnt fit the entire screen. Also Im 6ft 230 and I was having to bang on the phone in order to type. It makes it extremely difficult to use and is overpriced., 0
Had it installed at the store and only had it on for a day and it slipped off., 0
Like the screen protector kind of expensive but I didnt have to hassle with putting it on, 0
Not that good for the price was not a fan of the product, 0
Fell off right away save your money and use something else, 0
Cover looked good but you have to push hard on it to get your phone to work., 0
The fit is good the screen stays clean but makes very difficult to use the keys on the edge of screen like 0p1q etc    Too annoying for this price, 0
This is the worst screen protector ever! It is so thick and awkward that it is impossible to input information into the screen without pushing down on the screen extremely hard with your finger. It makes it impossible to text and you might as well forget about swiping. Over priced and useless. Hate I spent any money on this product., 0
It peels off in two weeks. Touch screen does not work well., 0
So far it is working out great. The cost is a little high for what it is though., 0
Yea it fits the screen but at the top of the phone where the cut out is fir the camera it makes it hard to slide the screen down. It pop up around the edges on day 3 I kept pushing it back down to stick and I finally just removed it., 0
The screen protector cracked after one week without ever dropping my phone. New cracked continues to appear everyday., 0
Wouldnt waste the money. After being installed lost almost full function of touch screen and fell of 2 days later., 0
Normally zagg products are really good but in this case they just didnt deliver. The way the edges are designed it makes the screen protecter come off and it leaves bubbles ate the ends and the adhesive on the edges isnt clear, 0
Makes screen almost unusable. I wasted my money on this., 0
overpaid for this screen protector and it pops off at least once a day. I havent had the screen response problems others are complaining about but am very disappointed in the quality of this product for the money, 0
This is the biggest waste of money. Do not bother. The screen protector lowers the sensitivity of the touch screen so much that you have to apply a good amount of force for everything. Also makes it almost impossible to pull down the drop down menu from the top of the phone. Complete waste of money. I really want my money back., 0
These shields for the curved Galaxy S8 are not worth the money. They dont stay on and they break/shatter without dropping the phone. Mine broke in my purse., 0
The shield is nice and strong and the kit that came with it made it easy to install. The only thing I dont like about it is it leaves a small gap at the top of my S8 so when you run your finger across the top to open things at the top of the screen your finger gets lifted. For as much money as this is I expected more., 0
This $50 screen protector is a waste of money. The adhesive is only around the edge of the screen protector which causes the touch screen to lose its sensitivity. Dont purchase so far I have not found a suitable screen protector for my S8, 0
It doesnt fit the phone very well. I hate how you can see the adhesive on the sides it looks like a plastic film didnt get peeled off. The only good thing is that its goes good with most cases, 0
Overpriced  can not press hard enough for some of the buttons  can not pull down menu from top of screen  always skipping letters when typing because of pressure needed . . hard to read with bubbles in screen, 0
Only had for a week and cracked. Havent had a chance to pay for replacement. Didnt last long at all and for the price thats very annoying., 0
this product does not fit the phone edges very well. . not worth the money, 0
Couldnt text with glass cover on but for the price was trying. Dropped phone and glass cover fell off. Waste of money!, 0

Easy to manage and reasonable price perfect for my phone0, 1
 for the price they should have developed a better way to hold it on then the small strip around the outside, 1
95 for each protector PLUS the trouble and cost of returning the old one, 1
This is the best screen protector for the price, 1
Cons: Weak adhesive that gets worse with each day pops off easily after about a month scratches easily extremely overpriced, 1
 However it came at the cost of losing almost ALL functionality of the screen, 1
 Does the job of protecting the screen but at the cost of the screen touch response, 1
 I give it four stars because of the price and you can see the edges so you can definitely tell that its on there, 1
 Also these protectors are kind off pricey, 1
 Not worth the price at all, 1
 Good price best phone need more0, 1
Dont waste your money on this over priced screen protector! Only has glue around the edges and wore out and came off in 2 days\\r\\n I am very disappointed in the product especially for the price\\r\\nI got talked in to buying it by the Best Buy guy bc he said he would sell it to me for half the price bc of the computer taking forever to do my S8, 1
 And you have to pay the shipping costs which are 10$+ to get replaced, 1
 Yes there is a lifetime warranty but it costs $10 to ship the new one and the old one has to be shipped back, 1
 I suggest buying something cheap my guess is I will be out about $100 for the original cost and constant replacements over the next 2 years, 1
 When the protector did crack the screen was still in excellent condition and it was replaced for only the shipping cost, 1
 Youll have to press a little harder but its worth it to save yourself the price of repairing a broken screen, 1
Definitely worth the price, 1
 Best buy price matched Zagg, 1
 Didnt last long at all and for the price thats very annoying, 1
 I have to press a lot harder than usual just to write something I lose a lot on games because of having to press hard but dont always have time to do that since games could get fast paced but its not all that bad just feel that its over priced, 1
 Price match at check out and youve got the best product for the amount of money you spend, 1
 Hopefully it will help! Otherwise Ill just eat the cost and take my chances without it, 1
 Way overpriced, 1
 Would not recommend at all and is over priced, 1
 Very disappointing for the high price, 1
 Expected more for the price, 1
 For the price you would think it would have better functionality but its simply not worth paying $54 for a protector that compromises sensitivity, 1
Couldnt text with glass cover on but for the price was trying, 1
 A little pricey but a good product, 1
 Considering the cost of the phone protect it with the best product, 1
 It got so bad after a week that I used the free replacement warranty that cost me 11, 1
 The ""free"" replacement cost an additional $10 shipping cost, 1
