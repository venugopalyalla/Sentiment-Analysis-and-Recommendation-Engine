Purchased this screen protector to protect my Galaxy S8 original had a lot of bad reviews this is the 2nd version of the glass protector its like night and day wow recommend this to anyone who wants to protect their beautiful phone0,0
This screen cover protects very well\r\nAfter watching the install videos and implying the screen protector theres still some issues with the sensitivity Of the screen making it hard to use in the edge caught sticks out from the corners of a case0\r\nNice protector takes a bit of getting use to when touching phone,0
The screen protector does not fit well so typing and tapping are not accurate,0
Crystal Clear protection with a perfect fit,0
 It also had a permanent gap that trapped air between the screen and protector,0
Protects well but it can be difficult to push on apps that are located in the center of my phone0,0
This protects the screen on the phone well,0
This screen did protect the phone screen but on the second drop to a wood floor the zagg screen is broken in numerous pieces\r\nThis phone protector on both mine and my wifes phone have broken within a week of purchase\r\n Not sure if its the glass screen or the installer of the screen protector where we purchased\r\nThis is a great curved glass protector for the new Samsung S8,0
 While I enjoy the protection it offers installing it on the phone proved to be quite a challenge,0
 Only reason for 2 stars is I have no doubt this glass would protect against scratches since it protected my phone from being fast and useful,0
I like my new screen protector,0
I had read reviews before purchasing that the screen protector altered the touch sensitivity and that it was difficult to apply correctly,0
 This phone is really good looking but you lose alot of those Iooks by adding this protector,0
This screen protector also seems pretty fragile,0
 I cracked the protector twice within a week by hitting the edge of the phone on something but I do not feel that I have hit the phone very hard,0
 Now yes I am glad the protector cracked instead of my screen but I dont feel I hit the phone very hard,0
 If you want a screen protector from a company that stands by its products go with Zagg,0
 I am just not convinced that this is the best screen protecting option for the Galaxy S8,0
This is the best screen protector you can buy,0
I love the Zagg screen protectors and have used them before with great results\r\nThis $50 screen protector is a waste of money,0
 The adhesive is only around the edge of the screen protector which causes the touch screen to lose its sensitivity,0
" Don\t purchase so far I have not found a suitable screen protector for my S8""0",0
 Has dropped the phone multiple times and its been protected!0,0
 Then the whole protector just started coming off the phone0,0
 Although very protective,0
 I think the curved glass protector is a little pricey but it seems substantial,0
I had problems with the screen protector from the start and it popped off after a few days,0
 Like the glass screen protector,0
This screen protector does not work and you have to push down hard on the screen to press,0
I think this screen protector is the nicest one that I have had on a phone so far\r\nLove that I could drop a truck on my phone and my actual screen wouldnt break but I could drop my phone a couple inches onto harder surface and the protector spiderwebs\r\nGlass protector cracked within 1 week\r\n At least it protected my new phone\r\nThis is the second time I have purchased this screen protector\r\nBecause the S8 has the infinity screen these protectors are popping off and when they do they shatter easily,0
 My husband and I have had our new phones two months and have both had to replace the screenprotectors hes had to twice,0
Easy to apply and helps protect your phone screen\r\n Clean your screen peel the protector apply push out air bubbles and get moving with your phone\r\nThe screen protector is easier then it looks to apply\r\nI have always used glass screen protectors on prior phones and I like Zagg for their warranty and good products,0
 I purchased this protector for my new s8 and installed it and now I have to practically hammer my finger everytime I use the phone,0
ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Curve Screen Protector is a fantastic product that is easy to install and come with a life time warranty,0
The screen protector doesnt work well with the Samsung Galaxy S8,0
 If you have icons by the edge of the phone it is hard for the phone to register your finger with the screen protector on,0
 I had to replace with sapphire defense curve which is more stronger and remarkable touch sensitivity then glass protection,0
This screen protector is horrible,0
The case is rock solid and the screen protector is the toughest I have ever had,0
My wife & I both got new S8 phones and Best Buy strongly recommended the Zagg protectors at ~$30 each (discounted)\r\n95 for each protector PLUS the trouble and cost of returning the old one\r\nI used a film protector for 3 years on my old S5 with no problems\r\nThis is the best screen protector for the price\r\n I am an adult that does not abuse the phone never damaged one and always they are in a protective case (otter box) and have an adhesive protector on them\r\n I though this would be a perfect protector but I was so wrong\r\nAgain this is the second one that has done this and I will be returning for some other type of protection\r\n Was only the glass protector and the iPhone was fine\r\nSolid one piece glass covering that keeps the screen clean and protected\r\nGot this protector for my IPhone and it did exactly what it stated  it protected the glass after being dropped quite a few times,0
So I was skeptical about this screen protector for my new Galaxy S8 because of the round edges of the phone\r\n I had a screen protector for the Galaxy S7 and since I install it the edges was very hard for them to stay in place within a few days they would start to lift up\r\n This screen protector is really good\r\nNot sure why the reviews of this screen protector are so low??!! No issues with lifting no issues with touch sensitivity it DOES protect the phone screen,0
 I didnt have a case on the phone yet but I had BB put the screen protector on it the day I bought it and man am I glad I did,0
 The Zagg protector shattered,0
 Yeah $50 dollars gone but not my $750 phone AND Zagg is sending me a new screen protector for $9,0
"I put Zagg screen protectors on everything\r\nI have twice had the screen protector """"pop-off"""" the phone when accidentally dropped onto a hard surface",0
 Provides good protection is nice and clear and was easy to install,0
 Ive removed it and have ordered a different protector to try out,0
Its great protection but it seems to take away a little screen sensitivity especially toward the curved edge0,0
The protection is there and the application is easy but once you have it on your phone it makes every little swipe difficult,0
it does the job for protection but the phone is not as touch sensitive as I would like\r\n It protects the screen and looks great too\r\n The screen is so thin you forget its there but provides an incredible protection\r\nI will never buy another ZAGG screen protector ever0\r\nI usually dont like to give bad reviews but this glass protector for my Samsung Galaxy S8 had awful touch sensitivity,0
 Although it was very protective and clear but did leave smudges would not pick up any light touches to the screen,0
 When I removed the glass protector the phone had an immediate reaction to my touch,0
 I spoke with ZAGG over the phone and they are trying to address the issue but for now pass on this glass protector,0
1st thing right off the bat this item did indeed protect my screen from getting any cracks or scratches\r\n The way the protector attaches to the screen is atrocious there are many MANY dead spots all over the place that just made me regret buying it\r\n Thankfully I dropped my phone and the fall shattered the screen protector\r\n I claimed the warranty on it and requested the alternative sapphire screen protector which worked far better\r\nI purchased this screen protector for my new Samsung Galaxy S8\r\n It is a clear choice for screen protection with sensitivity of touch that enables ease of use\r\n Two days later the screen protector cracked\r\n99 to get another protector and then had to send the cracked protector back\r\n Ive had this screen protector since April and Im on my 4th one\r\nThis piece of protection is thick and Im sure will do a great job when I drop it but its a pain trying to scroll through pages looking for apps and difficult to type a text or email,0
Screen protector kept lifting up and you could see the glass edge - affected touch sensitivity0,0
 Protector seems pretty safe had a few dings on the screen and no damage so far so good,0
 I dropped my phone at work today and my screen protector cracked like a broken windshield from top to bottom,0
 Does the job of protecting the screen but at the cost of the screen touch response,0
I was given only two choices of protectors for the face of the S8 this being the better one,0
For the Samsung Galaxy S8 a screen protector is advisable since it is an expensive phone\r\n Zagg has a Curved Glass Protector that is perfect and it has a life long warranty\r\n Be sure to buy the Curved protector\r\nI am hoping that it offers the protection that it claims but the ZAGG screen protector impacts the touch sensitivity of the screen,0
I had a GS6 and always had a Zagg screen protector for the phone and loved it,0
 When I got my GS8 there was no question what screen protector I would buy for it,0
Easy to install fits perfect was concerned about the curved edges being protected but seems to be a good fit\r\nI feel like this protector does a great job of protecting my screen from any accidental damage,0
 This is my first time using a glass screen protector so all glass screen protectors may be like this but many times I have to press down much harder than normal for types to register which is a huge pain when texting,0
 I guess that is the trade off of having superior protection,0
"Was superior protection but screen was far less responsive\r\nI was VERY disappointed at how this screen protector makes certain regions of my screen almost """"untouchable"""" I have to push down hard as in grip both sides of the phone and squeeze to get certain touches to work",0
OK so its a screen protector\r\nwas not impressed with this screen protector\r\nThis screen protector is very strong and prevents scratches from drops\r\nI generally buy the thinner screen savers but decided to try the glass curve screen protector since I heard the curve of the screen on my Samsung Galaxy S8 tends to get scratched or broken easily\r\n This thicker screen protector is not as sensitive as the film but you do get used to pressing a bit harder on your phone\r\nIt isa good for protecting the screen on the phone\r\n That is the downfall of the protector\r\nI have been a long time owner of Zagg screen protectors for all of my phones and this is the first one that I have had a problem with,0
This screen protector did not adhere properly made it hard to use the touchscreen and made me hate my phone until I took it back,0
Protects phone great but moves around way too much and very difficult to push buttons0,0
I like having a good solid screen protector; it does make it bit harder to tap than with my old plastic sheet protector but Ive gotten used to it\r\n I then dropped it from less than 3 feet and the screen protector just splintered\r\n I returned the screen protector using their online service and the one I received again cracked in a different corner this time\r\n I just dropped my phone again at around 4 feet and the adhesive didnt stick onto the screen well at all and the protector came off\r\n When it came off of my phone the screen protector cracked again in a different corner! This product has by far been a huge disappointment not just at key sensitivity but at its core function of protecting my screen\r\nIve always used zagg screen protectors for my phones for years,0
 Contacted zagg and they sent me a replacement sapphire screen protector thats much better,0
 I keep it on for the protection and hoping Zagg will release an upgrade,0
 It does protect the phone,0
I was very nervous about this purchase due to the horrible reviews however after dropping my Galaxy S7 and cracking the glass I felt I needed more protection\r\n So many cheaper screen protectors why would I spend $50 on something that would be useless in less than a month? Completely infuriating\r\nStay away from the glass protector! Do not but this!0,0
 I ended up not liking any of the in stock covers but figured Id grab a screen protector while there,0
I purchased this S8 protector based upon an excellent experience with my older S6 and Zagg\r\n The only issue following installation was that the touch screen became less sensitive with the protector in place\r\nThe biggest problem was that a week after putting it into use I dropped the phone and the protector popped off\r\n But it was to no avail; the protector has popped off a second time from just bouncing the phone in a car console\r\nScreen protector goes on easy\r\nThe screen coverage and protection is good; however it limits some of the side swipe functions,0
Not a bad screen protector\r\nScreen protector fits very well and should be great for my S80\r\n If you are only worried about scratches from putting your phone in your pocket with keys or a purse dont be! The screen is impervious to that! I would recommend to spend your money on a good case instead preferably one that has edges that are slightly raised above the screen so that if you lay your phone down screenside down the screen wont be touching the surface and it will also help protect the screen better from falls\r\nDoes offer good screen protection when dropped\r\n Harder to access screen than film protectors\r\nWell for starters it almost always has an air bubbles between the screen and protector,0
 The sensitivity is horrible with this screen protector on,0
Great screen protector\r\nprobably the standard in scree protectors0,0
 Then again I am still getting used to it! Overall I feel this phone is well protected,0
 It looks as if there is water between the protection and phone,0
Works great to protect my phone but the glass makes it hard to type\r\nThe screen protector sometimes is frustrating as it doesnt read the swipe on the phone but I feel it does a great job protecting the screen0\r\nCurved glass needs protection and this does it\r\n Protection for a good value\r\nA must get if you want to make your phone screen last longer than your first drop! This screen protector is sleek tough and provides a great level of protection for your phone,0
Really like the protection it gives my phone and its fit0,0
This protector was very easy to install a perfect fit on my new Galaxy S8 !0,0
I like the screen protection but it has turned my S8 from a touch Screen to a Press Hard screen,0
I had the geek squad install this protective cover on my screen but now it is difficult to text\r\nThe screen protector cracked after one week without ever dropping my phone\r\n If you want light touch screen responsiveness this probably wont work for you - it does not react as well to touch as the thinner covers and nowhere near as good as not having a screen protector at all\r\n But I can say unequivocally it protected the phone exactly how it should have and was worth the 40 or 50 bucks we paid for it\r\nI order 2 of theses screen protectors,0
 I ended up ordering a completely different case since I wasnt going to keep messing with this protector and having to go back to the store,0
 Also these protectors are kind off pricey,0
The protector screen was very clear and gave the infinity edge an even better look\r\nI felt that this would be an ideal solution to the protection of the curved screen for my Galaxy S8,0
 Had to go back next day to return the screen protector,0
The way you put this glass protector on is great compared to older ones I have used\r\nScreen protector was easy to install,0
 Hopefully they redesign this product as we love our zagg screen protectors,0
Shield protector has been working ok not the best,0
This does its purpose and actually does protect the phone,0
Where the thickness of this screen protector should be perfect,0
 The peel and stick method of attaching the protector is substandard,0
The ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass Curve Protector is nice and sturdy,0
 It gives me a piece of mind of protecting my screen,0
" Good protection for my S8""0",0
 Got a different screen protector,0
I have always had glass screen protectors on my iPhones and loved them,0
 I put a Otterbox Symmetry on my phone and the case did not interfere with the screen protector at all,0
 Before I even had the Defender on it started to push the screen protector off,0
My niece suggested the Zagg glass screen protector,0
 Zagg is the best screen protector out there,0
The glass screen protector fits perfectly and does indeed protect the screen,0
Well Ive ALWAYS trusted Zagg to protect my Samsung so naturally I got the glass screen protectors for my s8 and for the phone I got my younger brother\r\nreally not happy about having to pay for yet ANOTHER new screen protector and neither of us have even dropped our phones\r\n I spent over 100$ on protecting my brand new phone to have the phone screen chip underneath this screen protector while in an otter box\r\nThis screen protector sucks plain and simple,0
 Also the screen protector would pop off very easily,0
 I have installed many HD glass protectors so I was confident installing it myself,0
"I\ve used many Zagg products so you can imagine why I am so so disappointed with this screen ""protector""\r\nThe glass shield fits perfectly on my Samsung s8 and protects it well",0
"00 for a screen protector to fall off the first time I drop it""0",0
Good protection for glass screen on S8 but seems to make it more difficult to access the items on edge of screen\r\nOriginally I bought the Otterbox glass shield because I had purchased the Otterbox protector case\r\nHad the Zagg screen protector on my Samsung 6 and loved it\r\n I think because of the curved edge of the Samsung 8 I have a problem with this screen protector\r\npurchased this screen protector for my daughters phone\r\nThe screen protector literally broke the same week I got my Phone after my phone fell from the sofa to the carpet! The bottom edge of my phone chipped and created to cracks on my actual phone screen since the screen protector popped off!0\r\n And has good protection\r\nIt was more expensive than the plastic shield and I am happy I put on this protection glass\r\nThis is the first use for this curved Zagg screen protector\r\nThis screen protector does its job probably too well\r\nThe first protector I purchased lasted 10 days,0
After reading initial reviews I was skeptical about purchasing this screen protector\r\n I spoke with a sales rep in store(she also installed) and she assured me that the glass protector was the best for protection for my phone\r\n Two weeks later I now have a crack in my screen protector that didnt come from a drop\r\nI like that the screen protector comes with a guide but it ruined the screen sensitivity0\r\nZagg has the best protectors and lifetime warranty to boot!0\r\n Full protection without sacrificing style\r\nThis screen protector is good for keeping the glass from getting scratched but it reduces the touchscreen sensitivity0\r\nAfter breaking the screen on my new Galaxy S8+ I decided to switch to the S8 and include better screen protection,0
Had my phone a few daysnever even dropped phone and my screen protector is already cracked\r\nI like the screen protector for the most part\r\nThe screen is well protected and having the glass be curved made it easy to apply,0
Purchased 4 phones and 4 protectors\r\nThe glass is very thick and while that protects the screen in a great way it was hard to get the screen to react to my touch! I had to push very hard and swipe several times before anything would happen! Also the curved part was impossible to get to work,0
The screen protector does not adhere to the middle of the phone,0
This screen protector never settled the way it Should have,0
Dont waste your money on this over priced screen protector! Only has glue around the edges and wore out and came off in 2 days\r\nBought two of these screen protectors for my wifes and mine new Galaxy S8s\r\nI bought this screen protector and had to return it for a lesser model0\r\nThe screen protector fits well but I fell like it makes the screen less sensitive to touch and it popped right off the screen when I dropped my phone0\r\n The screen protector is designed for this phone\r\n The protector does not follow the curve of the phone so the phone is very insensitive with the protector\r\n The protector was installed by Best Buy\r\n After one day I had enough frustration trying to use the phone so I took the phone back and Best Buy took off the protector annd gave me credit for i\r\n The way the edges are designed it makes the screen protecter come off and it leaves bubbles ate the ends and the adhesive on the edges isnt clear0\r\n Just wouldnt recommend this screen protector\r\n These screen protectors do not stay on the phone and do not keep dust from getting under the protector\r\n I work construction and need the each protection\r\n The screen protector only has adhesive around the outside which creates an air bubble between the protector and the screen\r\nWithin 2 days the screen protector lost its adhesive and fell off\r\n Im trying to live with this but had the phone without a screen protector for about 3 weeks before and the degraded performance is like night and day over the native screen\r\n Im not sure if its the capacitive coating or if there is still a small air gap between the protective glass and the screen that is causing the issue\r\nThese are crazy expensive screen protectors and they should work flawlessly\r\nI bought this screen protector as it seemed to be the only glass shield best buy carried for the S8 at launch\r\n This protector only adheres to the edges of the phone\r\nIt has done very well at protecting my screen with a toddler\r\nThis screen protector makes me hate my new phone\r\n Screen protector is awful for this phone\r\n I loved my zagg glass protector on my s6\r\nWent thru 4 different screen protectors\r\n After using the S8 glass screen protector I doubt I will ever buy a Zagg product again\r\noverpaid for this screen protector and it pops off at least once a day\r\nThis screen protector is awful\r\nI dropped my phone; however the screen was not affected in any way due to the protection of the ZAGG invisible screen protector,0
It might protect my screen but I have to BANG the surface too hard and things on the outer edged require multiple hard BANGS,0
Seems to keep the screen protected; hopefully comes through with any mishaps0,0
Didnr care for rhe screen protector,0
The screen protector fell off my phone within a few days0,0
 I dropped it one time and the whole screen protector goes flying off and gets dirty,0
loving everything about my phone and the protector screen0,0
The screen protector is really thick you lost looks a little funny sitting on top of the phone,0
 Also it only sticks around the edges bus there is air between the screen and the screen protector so the sensitivity near the sides and Screen is not the best and you really have to push hard,0
This glass screen protector only has a thin amount of glue around the edge\r\n When the protector did crack the screen was still in excellent condition and it was replaced for only the shipping cost\r\nHorrible screen protector\r\n Ive purchased about 5 ZAGG screen protectors and this one is a huge let down\r\n Not to mention the way the protector fit on the screen it would never detect the swipe down motion from the top to display my notifications\r\nBest screen protector I could get for my wifes S8\r\nI first tried another protective cover; lasted a couple weeks\r\n The install was a little tricky but well worth protecting your screen!0,0
Screen protector fits on my galaxy s8,0
 It protects the screen but i would not buy again because its annoying to type on,0
 The protector is well made and feels like a premium product,0
 The protector did its job and cracked but the phone screen is undamaged0,0
 Ended up getting a normal screen protector not tempered glass,0
This glass screen protector makes so dificult use the phone you have to push hard the screen\r\n Great for protection from scratching but thickness interferes with touch screen sensitivity\r\nGood protector,0
Screen extremely hard to use however tons of good protection\r\n Does the job protecting screen which is a must\r\nThis screen protector was the only one available in store when I was in and they recommended it so I went with it,0
 Prior to the screen protector the phone was very responsive and I had no issues with the sensitivity,0
 On average it takes me 3-5 clicks with my finger before an app would open with this screen protector on,0
In addition I had the screen protector on for six days before it cracked,0
 To put this in perspective I had my previous phone for three and a half years and the screen still looks perfect even though I didnt have a screen protector,0
 I was baffled when I took my phone out and saw that the screen protector had a crack,0
 I would expect this screen protector to perform well also0,0
Protect screen but it reduces the sensitivity and makes phone harder to operate0,0
 She tends to drop things & this protective shield is extra thick compared to the standard plastic coating,0
 In our home every phone must have ZAGG protection since we always buy our phones in full,0
This item takes a lot of time to get used to it even though it a good screen protector,0
Have had Zagg covers before an I like their durablity and protectiveness\r\n But the curved edges of the Galaxy s8 dont work with the glass screen protector\r\nImpulse bought this with my phone then heard protectors arent really needed anymore\r\nWith the help of Steven and Abby I was convinced that I had to protect this GREAT phone,0
I just bought 2 new Galaxy S8s today for my wife and I and got this screen protectors\r\n It has protected my screen from cracking but does not fit the curved glass very well & makes my touch screen difficult to use\r\nDefinitely better than the glass protector that I had0\r\nThe protector is so thick that it gets in the way of plugging the phone into the Gear VR headset\r\n Later noticed screen protector had cracked\r\nThe screen protector was clear and easily installed but the screen sensitivity was lost all together\r\n Have recently bought another Zagg screen protector for my s8 and love it\r\nthe glass shield is great for protection but it does make it a little difficult getting the apps to work without really pressing hard on them0\r\nHave this screen protector for about 2 weeks and its the second one that cracked0\r\n OtterBox did its job on the rest of the phone and the Zagg glass protector was definitely punctured by rocks in a few spots\r\n Definitely does the protection party guaranteed so Im happy with paying for the peace of mind\r\nZagg screen protectors are the best\r\nWhile this screen protector is probably very sturdy it made using the touchscreen very difficult! Too thick? You had to press and hold a while and then it only would work half the time,0
 The screen protector doesnt go to the edge of the screen which is good for a phone case,0
The screen protector is very sturdy and durable\r\n Much better adhesive than all of the previous screen protectors I have used\r\n It offers great protection\r\nGrrat warranty and protection\r\nThe glass adds extra protection to the phone\r\nI purchased this cover because I thought it would give me extra protection,0
 Its taking some getting used to and I must also add that this is the first time Ive had a glass protector on a phone so it could just be a different feeling for me,0
Screen protector fit perfect to my screen and works well,0
"This along with the one for S8+ is the worst Zagg ""protector"" ever! It doesn\t protect and renders the touch screen unusable\r\n Debris and hair always get underneath the protector\r\n Zagg should be ashamed and replace these with real protectors\r\n I\m going to try a different brand of screen protector (with good ratings) to see if it\s any better\r\nThe screen protector already fell off my son\s phone\r\nThe Zagg glass screen protector is so smooth that your finger just glides over the surface and making it very easy to key in anything The curve glass is a perfect fit and it protects the whole surface",0
After having the screen protector on the phone for about 2 weeks we finally dropped the phone,0
 I guess it did protect the screen but gave its life to do so,0
 When it is in place it made the touch screen on my phone more difficult to use since there was too much space between the screen and this protector,0
Tempered glass screen protectors are the only screen protectors I will use,0
 Ive seen a number of family members as well as friends who dont use screen protectors with broken and shattered phone screens,0
 A glass screen protector gives you one more level of protection from a broken screen,0
 Ive replaced my glass screen protector a couple of times (I only buy screen protectors with a lifetime replacement guarantee) where the screen protector is cracked and not the phones glass,0
 A tempered glass screen protector is still cheaper than having to replace the phones glass,0
Feel that phone is protected much better by this product,0
This protector does a great job of protecting the Samsung Galaxy S8 screen\r\nSo bad I had to exchange it for the plastic screen protector,0
 Then it makes selecting apps writing texts etc hard to do versus not having the protector on,0
99 and get a choice from 3 different protectors so you dont have to get the exact same one,0
 Id use Zagg products again but Id never buy this screen protector again,0
I purchased the cover to protect the outstanding looking curved screen0,0
It works for protection but drastically takes Way from touch sensitivity,0
I purchased this screen protector for my 10 year old sons new samsung galaxy S8\r\n I was not overly impressed with the look of the screen protector compared to the S5 we had previously\r\n The screen protector had a bubble underneath that was supposed to disappear but it never completely went away\r\n The screen protector cracked after three days without being dropped\r\n It did protect the phone but I have a feeling it will need replaced many more times than the previous versions\r\n Overall I would rather have this screen protector than have nothing at all especially for my young son\r\nSo far Im not happy with this screen protector,0
Besides that only a couple of weeks after getting the phone the protector shifted while I was on a road trip,0
I have used Zagg products on several of my earlier phones and have been very satisfied with the protection they provide to expensive phone screens,0
 Best Buy had a special where they installed the screen protectors free of charge,0
 Unfortunately I found the protector affected the screen sensitivity to the point I had to use excessive pressure to text or scroll,0
 The touch sensor gets totally lost when protector is on,0
 It is very nice for phone protection but the edges dont really stick on the phone,0
 Overall it is a good protector but I would look at different products and compare them first before settling,0
This glass protector was the worst Ive ever owned\r\nCan seem to find a good screen protector for my S8 if anyone knows of one please comment0\r\n It was nice since it gave the screen protection it promised\r\nseems to be a good choice to protect the phone screen,0
This screen protector makes the screen sesitivity nearly nonexistent,0
It is extremely easy to install this protector but it isnt as touch sensitive as stated in its description0,0
The Zagg screen protector was easy to install with all required items in the package\r\nHard to use my phone in general because of the lack of sensitivity from the screen protector\r\n Just for a little more protection\r\nI was able to applie the screen protector myself with the provided applicator and instructions0\r\nI bought this screen protector because I told the Best Buy rep that I wanted as close to indestructible as possible,0
 Should have read the reviews first because I found this to be so protective that it was not very responsive to my touch,0
 If you want protection buy it,0
Although the product will certainly protect your screen the issue is the plastic is too thick\r\n We went on vacation and both screen protectors cracked from being in a travel bag with others items\r\nThe screen protector has taken away touch sensitivity so bad that I hate having to text now\r\nI am anxious to get rid of this screen protector and would not recommend it to anyone\r\nAfter trying screen protectors for S7 I was concerned about buying class screen protectors for a curved screen,0
 However this screen protector does work very well as long as it is applied right,0
 The only problems I have with this protector are pulling down the notification panel from the top,0
"This screen protector turned my touch screen phone into a ""press hard"" screen\r\nThe screen protector cracked within days of use\r\n I had the screen protector put on by sales associates in hopes it was done correctly\r\n I have kept the protector on phone in hopes it will protect the phone screen\r\nI have used Zagg glass protectors before for all my phones",0
 However due to the S8 having a curved edge this protector has an air pocket throughout,0
 I replaced it with a plastic protector,0
 Although this is not as good protection as Id like it is worth it just to be able to type on this phone,0
protects well only complaint is that you have to push extra hard for the phone to sense your finger moving or touch,0
The screen protector did its job but it cut down on the sensitivity of my phone making it difficult to use at times\r\nIts good protection but starting to lift on bottom and top of phone after less then a week\r\nI was considering getting a thinner scratch protector because I figured it would have more touch sensitivity than thicker impact protectors,0
 Though it is true I feel its worth the sacrifice to have the extra protection,0
I put this screen protector on my phone and in less that 12 hours I took it off because my screen sensitivity was severely reduced,0
I tried using it for about a week and after not being able to get the notifications drop down drag down and horrible touch sensitivity I took it off and got one of the stick on plastic one (may not protect it as well but at least I can use the phone)0,0
 I dropped my phone at work today and my screen protector cracked like a broken windshield from top to bottom,0
"I purchased thinking that this would protect my phone\r\nThis is a really high quality screen protector very happy""0",0
 Why risk breaking your screen when this will protect it from cracking? I put them on all my phones and devices,0
This screen protector diminished the sensitivity of the phone,0
"This product offers great protection but it lacks the right fitment\r\n Other than than that it looks good and provides protection\r\nI\ve been buying these screen protectors since the start and love them!0\r\ngreat protection for the screen but you do lose touch sensitivity0\r\n My screen seems to get dirty quicker but I like the protection it offers\r\nThis """"ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Curve Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S8 - Transparent"""" protector did a good job protecting the screen; however it created problems using the screen",0
 Even after increasing sensitivity and after a few days of use it seemed to not be as responsive as other Zagg screen protectors used before,0
 A family member dropped the phone after a couple weeks which resulted in a line down the middle of the protector,0
 The screen didnt crack which is awesome (and expected) but the protector had to be replaced,0
" So we chose another one to replace it with specifically the """"ZAGG - InvisibleShield HD Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S8 - Clear"""" and the phone is much more responsive",0
Screen protectors a must have,0
 This protector covers the entire phone and is scratch resistant,0
Very protective and great quality for the S8!!!!!0,0
Protector fell off the first day on 2 of my new phones0,0
This is a great glass protector for the galaxy s8\r\n My husband dropped his phone after 4 days and the screen protector popped off and was too dirty to put back on\r\nIt appears to protect the phone,0
 The only downside is the screen is unprotected,0
 Happy with the protection it is giving,0
I liked the protection the Glass curve provided but it reduced the touch sensitivity of the screen too much to where I would have to consciously place a lot pressure to get it to register,0
Ive always been a fan of ZAGG they make amazing screen protectors all up until I bought this for my Galaxy S8\r\n This is because of the limited adhesive only being around the edges leaves a thin gap of space between the protector and the screen of the phone\r\n You have to press very hard to get any sort of response from the screen and forget even trying to drag down the notification bar the top edge of the protector also gets in the way\r\n For the price you would think it would have better functionality but its simply not worth paying $54 for a protector that compromises sensitivity\r\nIt is good For protecting the screen from scratches and so on0\r\n After returning it to the store I put a regular protection on it and I love my S8 galaxy phone\r\n The glass is literally too thick exchanged for regular protector\r\nThe Zagg screen protector is great\r\n You do loose some sensitivity with the protector but you get used to pressing just a little firmer\r\nThis screen protector is easy to clean and I forget it is there\r\nGreat quality screen protector and stays on well but its very hard to use the touch screen with\r\nThis screen protector is definitely worth the money\r\nThe screen protector is extremely fragile It shattered with a slight drop of my phone\r\nWithin 24 hrs the protective screen came of my phone in my pocket\r\nLike the screen protector kind of expensive but I didnt have to hassle with putting it on0\r\nThis was my 3rd purchase of the screen protector,0
3rd I had my phone on my lap and it feel off and the screen protector flew off and cracked and my phone cracked,0
 This is a sucky protector,0
I dont like the thick glass protection as well as my previous screen protectors for my S4 & S6,0
 Much easier to put on than the other glass protectors,0
Love the screen protector was easy to put on and seems secure\r\nI bought this along my search for a good screen protector and boy was this a total waste of my time and $,0
The Invisibleshield screen protector works great on my Galaxy S8,0
 It is hard to press the buttons with this protection and very hard by the corners of the screen,0
I will say though that I spoke to Zagg and they said they would no have a problem replacing my protector with there best protector for the S8,0
" Frankly after reading the reviews of the upgraded protector there were as much problems with the upgraded protector as the one I have now only different problems""0",0
The shield is a must have for protecting your screen,0
Zagg glass screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S8 was terrible,0
I have used other glass screen protectors for my Galaxy phones and they have worked great and I could barely tell they were on,0
 I still havent figured out what could have caused it but its time to get a different screen protector,0
"I thought it would be difficult to work with since it is thicker than plastic however I have no problem operating the phone with this protection\r\nLooks like it has to layers on the screen and the inner later is shorter than outer as a result dust lint gets accumulated between the protector and screen around the screen""0",0
This does a good job at protecting the screen,0
I bought this case thinking it would be like any other #1 glass screen protector\r\nThe screen protector doesnt truly go to the edge like the description claims,0
The glass protector for the S8 or any phone is a neccesity,0
 I wouldnt leave the store without a screen protector,0
 I am so frustrated with this screen protector,0
 THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR IS WORTHLESS!!!!!!0,0
 Multiple phones under my account and the protector stays in place on the galaxy 8 but on the galaxy 8+ is does not like to fully seal around the edges,0
The curved protector was a nice added piece of protection to our new phone and has saved the screen from being cracked once already\r\n While we like the added protection the added difficulty of using the phone while it is on makes this almost not worth having\r\nSo this screen protector definitely protects the screen I cant complain about that,0
It protects my phone well but should come with the phone,0
Zagg makes really tough reliable screen protectors\r\n Just purchase the film protector0\r\nThis tempered glass may protect your screen but your touches become unresponsive unless you press really hard on the screen especially around the edges\r\n Would not recommend this product not even if it were $10 I did end up getting the plastic screen protector from the same company and its much better and cheaper0\r\nThey finally made a curved glass screen cover for the best protection yet with the clearest cover\r\n Protects your screen from cracking if you drop your phone by the screen covers glass cracks first\r\nThis screen protector seemed to make it to consumers without full functionality\r\nI felt this screen protector was a bit expensive,0
I like the fact that it is easily cleaned and protects the screen quite well,0
The screen protector is just the same as the other ones they offer for other phones,0
This glass screen protector fits perfectly and enhances the overall look of the phone while doing its job!0,0
Poor screen protector because it only attached at the edges and there is space between the screen and protector in the center making touch sensitivity very poor\r\nIm sure it offers protection but am unhappy with the touch sensitivity of the phone itself now\r\nUnfortunately the screen protector was not allowing me t o type correctly0\r\nI bought this for my Galaxy S8 on the day of its release thinking I was going to go all out to protect my new phone,0
This screen protector makes it hard to use your touch screen\r\nGot this because new phone case didnt come with a screen protector but I havent had many problems,0
 There is one thing thats Im not a fan of when trying to pull down the settings menu by swiping from the top down the screen protector blocks the phone from recognizing what Im doing unless I put a little bit of pressure down as I swipe,0
All phones need screen protectors,0
Protects screen and dies not make it hard to use!!0,0
Protected my screen and cracked warranty isnt awesome as well0,0
Its a great way to protect your phone,0
While the screen protector did its job protecting the screen it also kept me from being able to use the touch features of the phone without repeatedly pressing the screen,0
 The last straw was when the phone was dropped from approx 18 inches and the screen protector popped off,0
 When returning the item was told that that branch did not recommend any protectors at this point in time0,0
the screen protector makes it difficult to access the icons on the screen0,0
Only protector in the store for S8,0
I like the way this screen protector looks on my new Samsung S8 (not noticeable at all) and how it does not impede my ability to tap the screen\r\nAfter using for just shy of 2 months Im having to do a warranty claim for my screen protector its shattered across the top and bottom and I am really easy on my phone\r\nWas not a great as the older ones were but still has good protection0\r\n Considering the cost of the phone protect it with the best product\r\n The Galaxy S8 cant detect touch through the glass protector\r\n Took it back and got the thin film type protector\r\n It was clear and quite protective\r\nI have never had a screen protector before getting my Galaxy S8,0
This screen protector would be nice if it would stay on\r\nProtects phone wonderful\r\nHad Best Buy install the new screen protector\r\n Great protection!0\r\nThe screen protector interferes with the top drop down touch area on the screen\r\nThis protector is good quality and do not create any distortion on the screen resolution\r\n The glass protector in my opinion doesnt cover the edges adequately and causes interference when swiping down\r\nAlso two days after a best buy mobile employee installed it I dropped my phone and the screen protector popped off easily\r\n Im not sure if he did it or it came that way but he tried to pass it off to me like I wouldnt notice its not possible to put the screen protector on and not notice significant scratches\r\nThe shield is great for the protection it offers; however I lost a lot of my touch sensitivity with my phone after putting it on,0
low quality screen protector,0
 Mine is fine with the protector on,0
 My issue is that my FIRST protector started peeling up at the top left corner and eventually started cracking (Im assuming from gently sliding into my back pocket lol),0
 Cracks spidered and less than a week after I purchased my husband and Is screen protector I had to use my warranty and get sent a new one for the low price of 9,0
99 for s/h! Welp its been about a month and my new new screen protector has cracked for no apparent reason,0
This protector makes the touch sensitivity extremely unresponsive!\r\n Worst screen every used Better buy a $10 screen protector that this expensive one\r\nWith this screen protector on my phone had so much trouble registering my touch that I had to remove it,0
I feel very confident that my screen is protected however I have to press the screen VERY HARD with my finger to get it to work\r\n However they have not yet figured out how to make a curved screen protector\r\n The protector pops off at the slightest bump\r\n I returned it and got the tech21 screen protector its not perfect but its leagues above the zagg at least on my galaxy s8\r\nTexting with this screen protector is a real pain,0
 Either the kid didnt know what he was doing or else the protector is just a piece of junk,0
 I feel like it provides great protection but it should be noted it doesnt fully cover the screen,0
I had the screen protector installed at the store\r\n I will be removing the screen protector as soon as I can! Dont waste your money\r\n This screen protector makes touching your screen frustrating\r\n Furthermore when my phone would drop the screen protector would fall off\r\nI just got my S8 today and got this screen protector because it worked so well on my S7 before,0
 The adhesive on this screen protector is around the edges only,0
 Im going to go back to Best Buy and see if they can apply the non-glass screen protector in hopes it works more fluently,0
 I will be returning this product immediately and probably just see how It will fair by not having a screen protector,0
 It came with a frame to pop onto phone with tabs to easily align edges of screen protector for perfect placement,0
This screen protector installed on an S8 leaves a gap between the outside edge and the inside edge of the Otterbox Defender\r\nThe idea of free replacement was great until I needed to make a claim and found out that it costs $10 for shipping! I was able to buy a different glass protector for cheaper with better touch sensitivity from Amazon,0
This is by far the worst screen protector I have used\r\n It lets moisture under the screen protector\r\n Once I removed the protector the screen functionality worked very well\r\nWhat I noticed was that the only part that stuck to the phone screen was the edge of the protector\r\n Im guessing this caused a gap between the screen and the protector on the front and thus causes the user to press harder for the touch to register with the phone\r\nWent in asking for a screen protector since noticing a scuff forming on the edge,0
 This is bad bad! Now I am out $60! Cant get another screen protector for a bit,0
I had already seen bad reviews for this product but always used zagg screen protectors for previous phones\r\n Worst but not least it doesnt stay on!!! I grabbed my phone and the screen protector came right off!!0,0
 This creates dead spots where I was pressing so hard just to type I was afraid I was going to break the screen protector,0
What good is a screen protector if it renders the phones basic features unusable?!,0
 Cant see how this is protecting anything,0
"I purchased two of these a couple days before the Samsung Galaxy S8 came out to ensure I had a nice tempered glass screen protector for my phone and my wife\s phone\r\nThe second box thankfully didn\t have a shattered screen protector so I applied it correctly to my wife\s phone after our phones finally came in and waited about 15 hours before tinkering around with the phone because screen protectors generally take time to settle in before use (generally 12 - 24 hours)\r\n The main issue was the phone wasn\t very responsive with the screen protector on in some spots of the phone it was almost bareable but others it took some extra pushing down on the screen protector to get the phone to respond\r\n The phone\s responsiveness without the screen protector is amazing so it really diminshes the awesome experience of the Samsung Galaxy S8\r\n The screen protector is made out of some very nice material but the adhesive and screen coupled together doesn\t make for a great experience\r\n I wouldn\t give this 0 stars if that existed on the overall rating scale as it does protect the screen but unfortunately it doesn\t make using the screen easy at all since you need to really apply pressure to get the phone to respond to commands\r\n I won\t give up on ZAGG but this isn\t the screen protector I was looking for or deserved and ended up returning the screens to Best Buy for a refund\r\nI do not recommed the InvisibleShield Glass Curve Screen Protector for the Samsung Galaxy S8\r\nThis is a very good screen protector\r\n It\s held on to my phone pretty well and screen sensitivity is great! That\s a first out of all the tempered glass screen protectors I\ve used\r\nHad the girl who sold me the phone put the screen protector on\r\nI always use zagg to protect my phones this one is a great product like all the others just don\t like the fact that it doesn\t cover the full screen and i can somewhat see the edge of the screen protector""0",0
 Still protects it but dissaponted that I paid $50 for something that should have been developed better,0
I like the color and the protection it gives and not worried dropping it0,0
I always get this type of protector for my phone,0
The screen protector has stayed on,0
Got this because new curved screen caused otter box to not make screen protector,0
 and the protector collects dirt and fingerprints like a seasoned FBI agent and they simply dont wipe off like the other products i have used or the natural screen itself,0
You cant tell I have a screen protector on my phone,0
Always use Zagg screen protector,0
 Stays on well and protects the edges of my phone0,0
This is a nice protector,0
wife had the screen protector on for a week and when she drop her phone the screen protector fell right off\r\nAlso this screen protector decrease touch sensitivity\r\n The screen protector lowers the sensitivity of the touch screen so much that you have to apply a good amount of force for everything\r\nAs others have stated this glass protector makes the device unresponsive to touch feedback,0
This is by far the worst screen protector I have ever bought from Zagg,0
 It causes a terrible gap between the screen and the protector which makes the touch function horrible,0
I was so excited to see a glass screen protector for the curved screen but it is not what i expected\r\n I have Zagg glass protectors on other products and I love it\r\n Not this curved screen protector though\r\nIf you want a glass screen protector Zagg has the best replacement warranty,0
 Ive used these for years on all of our phones and have had to replace quite a few screen protectors no screens broken so far,0
No bubbles full screen protection clear and fits screen perfect,0
The top of the protector is where the scroll down for setting or notification stuff to access,0
 Im more concerned with breakage protection performance (which I have not tested,0
 I purchased the curved glass protector for my new Samsung Galaxy S8 plus at a ZAGG authorized dealer who took great pains to put it on right making sure that the protector actually adheres to the entire screen not just the edges,0
 Its a beautiful protector that feels just like touching the original gorilla glass and its much better that the normal plastic protectors,0
 Im a big ZAGG fan and have used their HD plus plastic protectors on all my devices prior to this,0
" The curved glass blows all the past protectors away!""0",0
The protector is so thick that it is hard to get a good touch response especially when using the pull-down menu or the curve of the screen\r\n Three days after application my phone was dropped from a low level (2-3 feet) and the protector popped off of my phone shattered and cracked\r\nProduct is great and really protects your phone\r\nI like a screen protector had one on the phone that was replaced never had a broker screen,0
Good protection and smooth finish however there were what looked like bubbles in it for about 3 days,0
 There is also a visible line in the protector where the screen starts to curve and doesnt go down quite far enough to meet the case,0
Great glass screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S8,0
I have used Zagg screen protectors for all of my familys smartphones for years\r\n It took the BB guy 3 times to get this to apply correctly and during that installation 3 different boxes of protectors because theyd break so easily and we still walked away with this piece of garbage on my daughters phone\r\n I think its because the protector is basically sitting on top of the phone itself\r\n Dirt hair whatever seems to creep in under the protector so how is that protecting from scratches? Not to mention its annoying to see that underneath\r\n But this protector needs a recall and refunds! I hate it and the one for my S8+ and plan on leaving this same review for that one too!0,0
I would have given this more stars however my wifes screen protector came off the phone when she had it in her purse,0
So this was my 3rd attempt at finding a good screen protector and I must say this was the worst one,0
I was sceptical of a curved screen protector but this works with the infinity screen perfectly\r\nI dropped my new phone within a few days of purchasing the invisible shield protector,0
 The protector cracked across the middle,0
Extra protection for the glass shouldnt mean a loss in functionality\r\nTouch screen becomes completely unusable after installing this screen protector\r\n So now I would rather protect the front glass than risk it breaking from a drop\r\nWanted to get a screen protector to protect my new phone\r\nIn hope of trying to protect my brand new phone from scratches I went to the best place I could think of in order to buy the best for my phone although the gentlemen that did help me was wonderful as can be and did give me discount on the protector I was severely disappointed in the product,0
When applying it the sticker that protects the screen from being scratched before applying to your phone would not come off resulting me dropping it and the sticky part collecting carpet fibers and such and now it does not stick to the screen perfectly,0
 This is the worst screen protector I have ever used,0
I have purchased Invisible Shields for every phone I have owned and theyve always been the best quality screen protectors\r\n This screen protector is an entire let down from any Invisible Shield I have purchased\r\n The screen protector also can move around because it is so weakly adhered\r\nVery disappointed in this $50 screen protector\r\nI got the screen protector and I plan on taking it back,0
Product fits and protects phone as it says is should0,0
This screen protector is not worth buying,0
I purchased this Invisibleshield screen protector\r\n Supposedly it has adhesive over the entire protector\r\nI love Zagg and have had their screen protectors for many phones,0
" I have no screen protector now and am waiting for a Zagg FIX!!""0",0
This is the worst screen protector ever! It is so thick and awkward that it is impossible to input information into the screen without pushing down on the screen extremely hard with your finger\r\n Which is too bad cuz these screen protectors usually kill it\r\n There is an air pocket between the screen and protector that compromises the capability of typing swiping etc on the phone\r\n Do not waste your money on this case! I am planning of purchasing the Whitestone Dome Glass next as it appears to be the best glass screen protector for the S8\r\nGreat protection but the glue trim that you can see is a disapointment0\r\nGlass protector got dusty on it to easy and the dusty would stay trapped on there fell off way to easy and very price0\r\nThe screen protector came off easily when I first got my phone and my cats hair gets stuck on the side easily since it is curved,0
 But it does protect my phone I dropped it once and it is fine,0
You get good protection but cosmetically speaking isnt a good product0,0
 I would recommend using the phone for a while without a protective cover so you can see the true qualities of the keyboard before covering it with this protector to compare before and after,0
 Also close to the edges of the screen protector you can see a line that interferes with the beautiful screen,0
This was one of 3 screen protectors available at BB for a S8,0
 The screen protector that came with the phone is so much better,0
 This screen protector was a definite disappointment,0
 The protector does not adhere to the entire screen,0
 You had to press very hard onto the screen to get it to scroll if you could even get it to scroll at all with the protector on it,0
"The screen protector does not stick very well had to be replaced within a week of buying it\r\nHas protected several of my phones great accessory""0",0
I like it and wanted it to protect my new phone,0
This screen protector is very thick,0
 I returned this one for the other one by the same company that is much thinner but offers great protection too,0
 After installing the screen protector I had a very hard time using my phone,0
 Get one of the plastic screen protectors not this because its no good0,0
Reasonable one ! Good one for a transparent protection,0
 Fortunately I have not dropped my phone and experienced the screen protector breaking or falling off but I can HARDLY use my brand new phone,0
 I literally have to push as hard as I can to do ANYTHING on my phone with this screen protector,0
The screen protector works good but screen sensitivity is compromised by the screen protector\r\nthere is a outline about 2 mm from the edge that borders the entire protector which is kind of annoying,0
 Mine occasionally has a film that appears along the vertical center as if there is a gap between the protector and screen making a rainbow film/bubble,0
 The Edge swipe function is hindered because the edge of the protector is jagged and catches the finger when attempting to swipe so you have to mess with it a little,0
I have found the ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Curve Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S8 very good and durable,0
 This screen protector broke with in 12 hours of it being put on my phone,0
 Save yourself 50 bucks and some anger and buy another kind of screen protector,0
Dropped my galaxy 8 on concrete after having it for 2 weeks the screen protector broke but my phone was fine,0
 Zagg did replace my screen protector for free,0
Its a basic protector\r\nI got my galaxy s8 and then went to buy a screen protector and I go to best buy often\r\n The sales associate showed me to the protectors and made the description of these being a good protector and so I bought it\r\n Its been weeks and the protector is still working well\r\nBought one of these screen protectors for myself and one for my wife\r\n Within 2 weeks both my wife and I had cracks in the screen protectors but neither of us had dropped or mishandled our phone\r\n I have used several of the glass screen protectors with great results but not this one\r\nGreat screen protector\r\n This protector and my Nomad Folio Wallet case I can be assured the cell phone will not get scratched and stay looking new\r\n After putting the protector on my phone (it went on perfectly with zero air bubbles or dust) I find that I have to bang my fingers on the phone to get a response\r\n Have to push so hard Im afraid Ill break the screen protector and swiping down from the top is bad as well\r\nI have been using the screen protector for about a month now,0
 The screen protector flew off but the screen was fine,0
 I am not sure if the protector actually worked to prevent a crack or if the phone just fell in a way that did not harm the screen but either way I was happy that my new $700 phone was fine,0
 I do notice that on the curved sides of the phone I have to press a little harder on the screen than on the middle but if the phone screen is protected that is a small price to pay,0
 I rated the phone a 4 rather than a 5 for the protector flying off and the added pressure needed on the sides,0
Great protection for expensive product,0
My phone fell less than 6 inches and the protector broke\r\n The phone would have been fine even without the protector\r\n It is a scratch protector only\r\n But fits the phone better and easier application than typical protectors because of the curved screen\r\nthis screen protector started to crack from the top corner shortly after purchasing new Samsung galaxy s8\r\nThe reason for the 4 stars and only reason is that it breaks really easy which is good cause it absorbs all the shock but I had to replace it already in a week I had it to best buy which is awesome they let me return it and since I payed for them to put it on every time it breaks for eight dollars more just one time when I purchased it was great but I only have maybe a couple times left till they wont and Ill have to send it in to the company then wait for me to hear back then get the new one then go to best buy to have it put on lol but still great protection product :)0\r\nThis screen protector covers the main part of the phone top is not covered however you have to press hard on the screen this is not user friendly shouldnt have to tap 3-5 times just to open up a page,0
CHANGED TO A NON GLASS SCREEN PROTECTOR WHICH WORKS PERFECT,0
Screen sensitivity was terrible with protector on\r\n I still need a protector on my cell\r\n It offers great protection but in doing so its so thick that It takes a lot of pressure on the key pad to register the entry\r\nI hated this screen protector\r\n I had already purchased and discarded a cheaper glass protector I bought online because the adhesive was only on the edge\r\n You can also sometimes feel the glass protector click against the screen\r\nGood protection for the screen but the product does not seem to be well suited to the curved screen,0
 It is thicker than other glass screen protectors I have had which sometimes affects the sensitivity of the screen,0
My husband bought a new Samsung S8 and the defender otter box with this Zagg Screen Protect,0
 The first screen protector we had best buy install it and less than a week it came off sent it back and the next one we installed it our selves same issue,0
"protects well - has been dropped several times protected the phone 100%""0",0
This product is no good it does not protect my phone and its not glass0,0
The Zagg Screen Protector seems quite sturdy; however it seems to make the touch a little less sensitive\r\nCame home applied the glass screen protecter myself with no problem\r\nGood screen protector easy to keep clean but not sensitive enough on the edges\r\n Other than that good protection\r\nThe glass screen protector seems extremely and durable,0
 Im certain that it would provide satisfactory screen protection,0
 But that protection comes at a price,0
 The user must REALLY tap the screen very hard to penetrate the glass protector and activate the touch screen,0
 I gave up and returned the protector,0
No change in the use of the phone after the protector was added!0,0
Dropped my phone once and the screen protector popped off and my phone was not sensitive enough with this screen case exchanged out for a different one with zagg0,0
ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Curve Screen Protector not really good and expensive\r\nTime to get another new screen protector again now\r\nIt is a good protection for the phone\r\nThis protector inhibited the touch sensitivity to the point of frustration\r\nDont waste your money purchase a good case that protects all in one,0
It really protect my phone i always drop my phone\r\n I complained to ZACH and they were great and sent me an upgrade to the sapphire glass protector and that has already been scratched by just keys\r\nIt protects fine but i had issues with sensitivity with the edge of the screen and you can see the glue on the edge of the protector0\r\n Its thicker than previous screen protector I had on my Note 4 so Im finding the sensitivity is affected\r\n Im happy though if it protects my phone as Im sure to drop it! :)0,0
 I thought it would make my phone more protected,0
Works to protect screen,0
So I spent $700+ on a new Samsung Galaxy S8 only to be screwed by this horrible screen protector\r\n Best Buy person also go her fingerprints all over the bottom side of the screen protector\r\n I thought I had a couple of dead spots and was going to have to return my phone and it was the protector\r\n But I do like the extra protection\r\nIt gives a great protection but it is too hard to type something\r\nI had to have the screen protector removed as it caused the screen of the 8 to be unresponsive\r\nHaving an extra layer of glass to protect your $750 phone is a great idea! but only if it doesnt impact the usability of the device,0
The main problem with this screen protector is the fact you can see how it does not actually stick to the curved edges so it looks like it is coming off\r\nBought 2 of these screen protectors and they both Popped off with in a couple days0\r\nIts great on protecting your screen\r\nThe touch is a little difficult less responsive/slower response than the phone itself but protective and off the phone except for the edges so it should be extra protective,0
The screen did become less sensitive after applying the screen protector,0
 I contacted Zagg and they will be sending me a different style of Zagg screen protector,0
Seems a bit reflective for a screen protector; its okay0,0
The screen protector is very sturdy a bit hard to get used to the thick screen\r\nThe fitment was good as it was very easy to apply but the screen protector totally ruined the screen sensitivity\r\nThis product is up to Zaggs standards but seems to require more pressure on the Samsung S8 than other glass screen protectors from Zagg,0
Product offers great protection but on the smaller S8 it did not sit flush with the screen and it lost some touch sensitivity,0
This screen definitely will protect your phone screen BUT it makes it very difficult to use\r\n My case consistently pushed on the edges of the screen protector \r\nGo with the Zagg film screen protector\r\nIt really protects the screen\r\nI thought that the glass screen protector would offer better protection for my phone,0
 However it was hard to use the touch screen with the glass protector,0
Once I installed this screen protector per the installation instructions it left a massive dead spot in the middle of the screen rendering the phone mostly useless\r\n 2 screen protectors = $100 thrwn away\r\nThis is the worse screen protector you can buy for a S8\r\n Whitestone Dome Glass screen protector is the best and cheaper\r\nI bough this screen protector for my new S8 the worst screen protector ever touch does not work and it does not stay on the screen at all,0
Very good protection,0
This is a perfect screen protector for the Galaxy! Was even able to place on the phone without having to remove the case,0
I love the protection this screen cover provides but recently experiencing trouble with response to touch so it takes a while for an action to proceed0,0
 The S80 has a curved screen so its worth the investment to protect it0,0
This screen protector is as tough as they say however it limits the touch transmission so that you have to push harder and longer to get the phone to respond,0
The screen protector stuck well to the phone and hugged the curved edge as it was supposed to,0
 My biggest issue was that the screen lost all sensitivity because the protector was so thick,0
Purchased this screen protector for my galaxy 8 and it fits perfectly and offers awesome protection for your screen,0
 I love the security knowing my phone is protected,0
This curved glass protector is makes it difficult to use the touch screen\r\nReplaced this with a much cheaper protector\r\n Protector\r\nI love glass protector devices but on the Galaxy S8 there is no way to increase the screen sensitivity,0
Simple New Phone best protection for the screen This is a proven best protection for your phone0,0
 My protector fell off and I didnt even know! the adhesive gave out around the edges and literally fell off,0
When Galaxy S8 came out the first curved screen protectors REALLY missed the mark - lots of distortion on curved sides and a great deal of trouble typing at ends of keyboard\r\nbecause the phone is curved on edges this screen protector has a hard time staying on have used 2 of these now since July not happy that a simple little drop causes the screen protector to just pop off!! not break just pop off,0
Good product to protect my phone,0
The screen protector is very thick and is hard to get my phone to work with it0,0

Great protection but very hard to press the buttons when texting or emailing0,0
This glass protector fits the entire phone on all sides,0
 Glad it wasnt my phone screen but I was so happy to return it! I got the Zagg HD Clear cover which protects from scratches,0
I have enjoyed this screen protector,0
 The phone did not drop this is not a screen protector,0
 Took a bit off getting used to but its worth to protect my phone,0
This screen cover offers good protection against scratches but it makes the screen a little thicker and you have to press down a little harder0,0
This protective screen fell off in 1 hour and I paid for installation!0,0
The screen protector is not a good product\r\n The sapphire protector is much better,0
Curved glass needs protection and this does it. Protection for a good value.,1
Simple New Phone best protection for the screen This is a proven best protection for your phone,1
I thought it would be difficult to work with since it is thicker than plastic however I have no problem operating the phone with this protection.,1
Its great protection but it seems to take away a little screen sensitivity especially toward the curved edge,1
Great protection but very hard to press the buttons when texting or emailing,1
This screen cover offers good protection against scratches but it makes the screen a little thicker and you have to press down a little harder,1
I love the protection this screen cover provides but recently experiencing trouble with response to touch so it takes a while for an action to proceed,1
Good Protection at a decent price. It has held up decently thus far...,1
Installation was very easy product design seems cheap for what you pay and doesnt cover entire screen. Great for protection from scratching but thickness interferes with touch screen sensitivity.,1
Crystal Clear protection with a perfect fit. Easy installation,1
Zagg makes really tough reliable screen protectors. Guaranteed.,1
Good protection and smooth finish however there were what looked like bubbles in it for about 3 days. There is also a visible line in the protector where the screen starts to curve and doesnt go down quite far enough to meet the case.,1
Very good protection. Great fit for the curved edges of the Galaxy S8.,1
The curved protector was a nice added piece of protection to our new phone and has saved the screen from being cracked once already. However it makes using the touchscreen on the phone very difficult. You almost have to hit the screen for the phone to recognize you are selecting something. The pull down alerts bar at the top is nearly impossible to get to on the first second or even third attempt. While we like the added protection the added difficulty of using the phone while it is on makes this almost not worth having.,1
They finally made a curved glass screen cover for the best protection yet with the clearest cover. Protects your screen from cracking if you drop your phone by the screen covers glass cracks first. I highly recommend it.,1
"After breaking the screen on my new Galaxy S8+ I decided to switch to the S8 and include better screen protection. With the help of a BB associate purchased and installed this screen shield. Fingers crossed no breakage so far caused by ""OPERATOR ERROR"" - me.",1
This piece of protection is thick and Im sure will do a great job when I drop it but its a pain trying to scroll through pages looking for apps and difficult to type a text or email. You have to really mash your finger down on it to select an app or pushing numbers to make a phone call. Its far from sensitive.,1
The glass screen protector seems extremely and durable. Im certain that it would provide satisfactory screen protection. But that protection comes at a price. The price is that texting became extremely difficult. The user must REALLY tap the screen very hard to penetrate the glass protector and activate the touch screen. I gave up and returned the protector.,1
"The glass shield provides excellent protection. However the phone is not as responsive to touch as it is without the glass shield. This is a minor irritant that I have become accustomed to after a while. It just requires a firmer ""touch"".",1
This screen protector is great in covering the screen of my new phone,1
I first tried another protective cover; lasted a couple weeks... Zagg much much better... v. satisfied!,1
Screen extremely hard to use however tons of good protection.,1
My daughter dropped her phone several times already and there was no screen breakage,1
The case is rock solid and the screen protector is the toughest I have ever had.,1
"I have twice had the screen protector ""pop-off"" the phone when accidentally dropped onto a hard surface.",1
I purchased the cover to protect the outstanding looking curved screen,1
This product provides great protection for my sons cell phone. The screen looses a bit of sensitivity but after seeing what happened to my nieces phone when she dropped it I would say the protection is well worth it. I had ZAGG Invisible Shields put on my wifes and my cell phones and after several years of being smacked around we have no damage. I will buy it again.,1
I dropped my phone; however the screen was not affected in any way due to the protection of the ZAGG invisible screen protector.,1
great protection for the screen but you do lose touch sensitivity,1
My one complaint is that I still have a spot that isnt quite adhered in the middle and it makes it blurry there.,1
It gives a great protection but it is too hard to type something.,1
The shield is a must have for protecting your screen.,1
I like the color and the protection it gives and not worried dropping it,1
Great glass screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy S8.,1
Really like the protection it gives my phone and its fit,1
This shield has already saved my screen from getting broken.,1
The screen coverage and protection is good; however it limits some of the side swipe functions. It also decreases the sensitivity of the phone causing you to have to press a lot harder on the screen. I contacted Zagg about the issue and they sent me the sapphire defense which works much better.,1
cost was affordable    fit was perfect    clarity - remains clear and unaffected by fingerprints    protects well - has been dropped several times protected the phone 100%,1
This product offers great protection but it lacks the right fitment. The center tends to separate from the original phone glass which causes it to look as if moisture is in between. Then the top disables the scroll down menu to access quick settings. Other than than that it looks good and provides protection.,1
This screen protector is as tough as they say however it limits the touch transmission so that you have to push harder and longer to get the phone to respond.,1
Installation was very easy. The protector is well made and feels like a premium product. Absolutely clear. Only downside is some touch sensitivity loss around the edge. I managed to leave my phone on my rear bumper and close the trunk lid directly onto the face. The protector did its job and cracked but the phone screen is undamaged,1
I feel like this protector does a great job of protecting my screen from any accidental damage. It is also crystal clear with no color distortion. My only gripe with it is screen sensitivity. This is my first time using a glass screen protector so all glass screen protectors may be like this but many times I have to press down much harder than normal for types to register which is a huge pain when texting. It has gotten better since it got to bed in after the first week but it still has diminished sensitivity. I guess that is the trade off of having superior protection.,1
Unfortunately poor installation of this terrific product is causing many of the negative reviews. I purchased the curved glass protector for my new Samsung Galaxy S8 plus at a ZAGG authorized dealer who took great pains to put it on right making sure that the protector actually adheres to the entire screen not just the edges. The before and after difference is not perceptible - the touchscreen is just as responsive as before with no lag at all and no need to apply additional pressure to get it to respond. Its a beautiful protector that feels just like touching the original gorilla glass and its much better that the normal plastic protectors. Im a big ZAGG fan and have used their HD plus plastic protectors on all my devices prior to this. The curved glass blows all the past protectors away!,1
The first one was installed at Best Buy. It had a multi-colored haze if held in the right light. Kind of like an oil slick on water. I returned it and the friendly Best Buy guy removed it and installed a new one. The second one has the same problem. Its not visible when looking straight on at the screen but can be seen when viewing at an angle. Ive decided just to live with it.,1
Got this for my s8 and it took a tumble while getting it of the car. Must have fallen flat face first. OtterBox did its job on the rest of the phone and the Zagg glass protector was definitely punctured by rocks in a few spots. Took it off and the actual screen was totally fine and still get to put another Zagg on after using the warranty and only it off pocket on shipping for a brand new replacement. When its on it doesnt fit 100% perfectly due to the curve and the glue doesnt reach out all the way to the edge of the shield leaving a fingernail of a border collecting dust and pocket lint around the screen. Definitely does the protection party guaranteed so Im happy with paying for the peace of mind. Price match at check out and youve got the best product for the amount of money you spend.,1
First the good. It is well made and thick. Provides good protection is nice and clear and was easy to install. The not so good. Adhesive is only around edges. Not strong enough to hold if you drop your phone even a short distance. For me this design also resulted in poor touch sensitivity especially towards top of screen. Screen popped off three times and got some specks on inside which cannot clean off effectively without touching the edge adhesive. Ive removed it and have ordered a different protector to try out.,1
Horrible screen protector. Had BB install it with its centering tool and I was excited. Till I tried to use my phone. Screen has lost do much sensitivity. Almost impossible to push letters near the rounded edge. Swipe is the only way I can type anything. It takes about 10 tries to open the top down menu to get into notifications and settings. Might be tough but makes me want to throw my brand new phone at the wall. Ive purchased about 5 ZAGG screen protectors and this one is a huge let down. Would love to exchange it for a thinner one. This review took about 15 minutes to type because my keyboard doesnt recognize anything. :-(,1
"Didn\t even question not getting a zagg shield for the new S8. I know my phone gets dropped sometimes and that it often rides in a pocket with change and other ""sharp"" or ""pointy"" metal things. So it was a given for the shield. Plus I don\t want to put it on myself. Zagg has in the past gotten great reviews and has done an admirable job for other phones for me...much better than other after market shields that I\ve gotten from Ebay. However I do have one big gripe about this shield. It seems that the very edge of the shield ends on the curve of the screen of the S8. So anytime I\m trying to pull down the status bar on the S8 I\ve to position the phone and literally the tip of my finger to get the bar to pull down. It\s actually really really annoying at times. One other thing I\ve noticed is that there\s a lot of fuzz and lint building up between the glass shield and the case I bought. It\s tough to get into the curve to clean that out. Oh well.",1
I bought this product because with how expensive phones are I figured its better to be safe than sorry. After buying it Im just left sorry that I did. I followed all of the instructions step by step to make sure it was installed correctly. Heres a list of the problems I noticed. -Pushing buttons and screen responsiveness became immediately harder if not almost impossible. -I couldnt for the life of me get the top system tray to come down. So if there were a new notification for something I had to exit was I was doing and open the application in question. Obviously not the end of the world but the tray is there for that reason among others. -Trying to pushing anything on the sides of the screen was near impossible. Making typing extremely frustrating. -The screen fell off after a week. Just completely fell off of my phone. Even after following the instructions to the letter I got a weeks worth of use out of this product. When I went to pick it up off of the floor it cracked. Im not technically out any money of my own because I used a gift card I received from Best Buy after upgrading my phone but Im annoyed because that could have gone to something more worth it.,1
Bought this for my S8. It was nice since it gave the screen protection it promised. Looks good as well as finger prints or smudges come off easily by wiping. Glossy feel to it. However I find it a bit thick that it compromises the sensitivity of the screen. I have a hard time swiping down the drop down notification bar. There are areas usually the edges and towards the sides when I have to press harder for a key to work especially when typing.,1
Ive used the tempered glass on my Galaxy S5 and Galaxy S7. The tempered glass saved my husbands iPhone 6 Plus when he dropped it on the edge of a desk. It offers great protection. On the Galaxy S8 however it seems thicker and the curved edge makes it hard to use anything on the edge. I like to do crosswords on my phone but its hard when the letters appear on the edge. Im hoping ZAGG will come out with a version that is not so thick. I may go back to the HD plastic.,1
Good protection for glass screen on S8 but seems to make it more difficult to access the items on edge of screen. I have to touch several times before successful. Makes it harder to text takes longer and more frustrating.,1
The shield is nice and strong and the kit that came with it made it easy to install. The only thing I dont like about it is it leaves a small gap at the top of my S8 so when you run your finger across the top to open things at the top of the screen your finger gets lifted. For as much money as this is I expected more.,1
It is a good protection for the phone. It does not let you work the screen. You cant make the touch screen work unless you push very hard.,1
I ordered this since Best Buy did not have it is stock. It is very nice for phone protection but the edges dont really stick on the phone. Overall it is a good protector but I would look at different products and compare them first before settling.,1
Loses touch close to curves. Does the job protecting screen which is a must. Just wish the touch factor could be improved.,1
Have had Zagg covers before an I like their durablity and protectiveness. I will say it popped off my new S8 when I dropped the phone but it did not crack and I was able to easily put it back. I think the curved edge on the S8 may still present some challenges,1
Overall good protection Ive always liked this brand. It is very touch responsive however it cracked within a week. Register the product right away if you get one.,1
So far it works good. Would have been nice if the edges could have been bigger. Just for a little more protection.,1
Was superior protection but screen was far less responsive. Especially the edges. Was so frustrating I had it removed after 1 week.,1
The verdict is still out on this item. My screen seems to get dirty quicker but I like the protection it offers. The best buy associate put it on for me so quickly and it has a great warranty if you register it on line.,1
Great protection for expensive product. Love it! Wouldnt get a new phone without it!!,1
I really dislike this product. It offers great protection but in doing so its so thick that It takes a lot of pressure on the key pad to register the entry. Very frustrating.,1
Overall I have had good luck with the Zagg products. I think the curved glass protector is a little pricey but it seems substantial. The biggest downside other than the cost seems to be a loss of screen sensitivity that can be frustrating at times.,1
Good protection for the screen but the product does not seem to be well suited to the curved screen. It is thicker than other glass screen protectors I have had which sometimes affects the sensitivity of the screen. It also started to crack around the curve within a week or two even without drops or anything.,1
Easy to put on and looks great. Only problem I have is that my thumbs have a little arthritis and sometimes texting is hard as the glass if firm. Other than that good protection.,1
I just love Zagg Invisible Shield for the phone. It protects the screen and looks great too. The screen is so thin you forget its there but provides an incredible protection.,1
I bought this for my galaxy s8+ and my wifes galaxy s8. They installed it for mines because I didnt have my wifes phone on me I also bought a case and it was buy 2 accessories get a 3rd free so great deal. Protector seems pretty safe had a few dings on the screen and no damage so far so good.,1
Works great if you have a case to go along with it. I bought one for me and another for my wife. Easy to install.,1
I was considering getting a thinner scratch protector because I figured it would have more touch sensitivity than thicker impact protectors. Though its true I feel its worth the sacrifice to have the extra protection.,1
Good hard clear and responsive To touch. Good protection for my S8,1
I am hoping that it offers the protection that it claims but the ZAGG screen protector impacts the touch sensitivity of the screen. I have trouble with pull down menu and letters/symbols on keyboard located towards the edge.,1
After reading the instructions multiple times and watching someone do it on a Youtube video I was able to attach the glass shield myself alone at home. Happy with the protection it is giving.,1
I like the screen protection but it has turned my S8 from a touch Screen to a Press Hard screen. I hope I can adjust the screen sensitivity but I think not.,1
This item lives up to the hype. Will not use anything but glass shields in the future.,1
Had Best Buy install the new screen protector. Great protection!,1
The shield is great for the protection it offers; however I lost a lot of my touch sensitivity with my phone after putting it on. It drives me crazy not sure how much longer I will continue to use it.,1
I think this screen protector is the nicest one that I have had on a phone so far. Since the screen is curved like it is it seamlessly fits my phone.,1
I bought this case because it is supposed to prevent cracks as well as scratches. I had it installed by geek squad. I feel like it provides great protection but it should be noted it doesnt fully cover the screen. Also it is thick which makes it difficult when touching the screen. You have to press much harder. Pulling down the notification screen is equally difficult.,1
Does offer good screen protection when dropped. Harder to access screen than film protectors.,1
The protection is there and the application is easy but once you have it on your phone it makes every little swipe difficult. You really have to press down when youre using your phone it gets annoying.,1
it does the job for protection but the phone is not as touch sensitive as I would like. I heard from someone else that if it is not installed properly (S8 has curved screen) then it will not be as sensitive.,1
I purchased this screen protector for my new Samsung Galaxy S8. It is a clear choice for screen protection with sensitivity of touch that enables ease of use.,1
Keep your screen from getting scratched. Easy to install.,1
Purchased this screen protector for my galaxy 8 and it fits perfectly and offers awesome protection for your screen. I recommend this for the galaxy 8,1
Only draw back is  because of thickness makes it difficult to access applications. You need to tap icons harder.,1
The screen protector came off easily when I first got my phone and my cats hair gets stuck on the side easily since it is curved. But it does protect my phone I dropped it once and it is fine.,1
Product offers great protection but on the smaller S8 it did not sit flush with the screen and it lost some touch sensitivity. Worked great on the S8 Plus,1
I liked the protection the Glass curve provided but it reduced the touch sensitivity of the screen too much to where I would have to consciously place a lot pressure to get it to register. I also found with the screen off (displaying date and time) the discoloration of the glass screen was off putting.,1
This glass shield does a great job of protecting the screen of my Samsung S8. It fits perfectly. The only reason that I didnt give it 5 stars is because does increase the amount of pressure you have to apply to press a button not much but a little.,1
The curve Glass shield made my S8 galaxy impossible to use. After returning it to the store I put a regular protection on it and I love my S8 galaxy phone.,1
Extra protection for the glass shouldnt mean a loss in functionality. I returned this product the next day after purchasing. The sensitivity is off so you have to press the screen really hard to get any buttons to work.,1
The glass shield fits perfectly on my Samsung s8 and protects it well. The problem is that its so thick that you have to push harder on the screen to get the phone to respond (really annoying when your texting). Also I dropped my phone once (like I have a million times before and it was fine) and the shield popped off and I wasnt able to secure it back on without it continuously falling back off. I dont know about you but I cant afford $60.00 for a screen protector to fall off the first time I drop it,1
Had this with my iPhone. Screen looked like it had cracked. Was only the glass protector and the iPhone was fine. Will never go without it again.,1
It works for protection but drastically takes Way from touch sensitivity. And ultimately will just fall off. * mine within a week. Possibly a result of gorrila glass on S8,1
I have never had any issues with ZAGG before. In our home every phone must have ZAGG protection since we always buy our phones in full. The ZAGG curve Interferes with the touches on our phones. My hubby and I have to press really hard several times before we get the phone to interactive.,1
This screen protector is very strong and prevents scratches from drops. It is easy to install (as long as install correctly. Most of the low star reviews are from people who didnt follow instructions). I was discouraged by the reviews until I bought it and installed it.,1
I would have given this more stars however my wifes screen protector came off the phone when she had it in her purse. As for mine it stuck on and I havent had any issues thus far. Both were installed the same so it wasnt an issue with the installation. Its only been a week so that could change.,1
The Invisible Shield is very thick and fits my Galaxy 8 perfectly. I have one small problem with the Shield and that is I have to touch a little harder to get the screens to move. Then again I am still getting used to it! Overall I feel this phone is well protected.,1
Fits like a glove. Made out of glass strong easy to clean. Keeps the phone safe. Considering the cost of the phone protect it with the best product.,1
Love the brand but the Glass invisashields do not hold up. Ive had to replace them at least 3 times with my old phone & Im about to turn in my new one for a phone Ive had less that 3 months. It has protected my screen from cracking but does not fit the curved glass very well & makes my touch screen difficult to use. I will be trading it in under warranty for an original Invisashield (if they make them for the S8),1
Pros so far    No bubbles full screen protection clear and fits screen perfect. Cons so far    The top of the protector is where the scroll down for setting or notification stuff to access. You have to push at the very top above the lip and have a chance of sliding that down     The only adhesive is on the edges I believe this is why there are no bubbles on the screen though. I havent tested it with the VR yet and don r know how it will perform.,1
I have no doubt this thing could withstand quite a bit of punishment....IF IT WOULD STAY ON MY PHONE. I had it on there for less than a week and the adhesive completely let loose. This appears to be a fairly standard problem across the industry. Please fix. Meanwhile I know it has a lifetime warranty but I think its ridiculous to need to replace the item after less than a week and in all likelihood repeatedly throughout the Life of the phone.,1
Sensitivity is reduced by this glass screen. Did not have that problem with glass for my S5. So far its staying on but its only been a week. Ive heard complaints about it. For now Id recommend but waiting to see if Ive a problem down the road.,1
Im sure it offers protection but am unhappy with the touch sensitivity of the phone itself now. Parts of the screen do not fit flat to the screen and sensitivity is very low. Once when it was hot and humid outside the screen was blurred every time I put my finger on the screen. Not happy. considering removing it but hate to waste the money - although right now Im not enjoying my phone either.,1
Ivent taken it off do to possible screen breakage. Its hard to use the keyboard I will stop being nice its a pain to use the phone period with this zagg glass on it. I work construction and need the each protection. Ive had other zagg glass on flat screens theyre a amazing product. If you dont Need it dont waste your money,1
I have been a Zagg users for years. This is the first time I am not happy with the Zagg and plan to follow up with the company. The Zagg makes it hard to touch/use certain areas of phone. I keep it on for the protection and hoping Zagg will release an upgrade. It does protect the phone.,1
I loved how easy this was to install. It came with a frame to pop onto phone with tabs to easily align edges of screen protector for perfect placement. But what caused me to exchange this was that it hindered functionality of the screen because its so thick. I couldnt lightly press or swipe on the screen but instead had to apply serious pressure for the phone to respond. It also had a tiny lip all the way around the edge that didnt fully adhere and actually made it really easy to pop the entire thing right off.,1
So maybe I dont need the screen because of the gorilla glass but I figured better safe than sorry. The issues I have (I have had it on my phone a total of about an hour now) are that the pressure sensitive functionality is dulled by the glass and it gets in the way when you drag down from the top edge of the screen. Also the glass disrupts the responsiveness of the keys adjacent to the curve. Ill give it a few days more but I think Ill end up trying another solution. I would recommend using the phone for a while without a protective cover so you can see the true qualities of the keyboard before covering it with this protector to compare before and after.,1
the glass shield is great for protection but it does make it a little difficult getting the apps to work without really pressing hard on them,1
Great protection but the glue trim that you can see is a disapointment,1
You get good protection but cosmetically speaking isnt a good product,1
Claims to be tough however it cracked the first time I dropped it 10 inches above ground on a wood floor.,1
Love my phone. And has good protection. . It was more expensive than the plastic shield and I am happy I put on this protection glass. Thanks again Best Buy.,1
I like Zagg products and that they come with a lifetime guarantee. It looks nice and fits tight to my Galaxy S8. I only gave it 4 stars because it doesnt fit around the curved edges all the way. This makes it hard to use the outside edge of the key board or play games that are all the way to the edge. But I do like the extra protection.,1
A must get if you want to make your phone screen last longer than your first drop! This screen protector is sleek tough and provides a great level of protection for your phone. It can be a bit tricky to place on your phone but is does come with a frame to help you place it on right. Totally worth the money for a calm state of mind for your screen. Enjoy!,1
This screen protector does its job probably too well. It makes it difficult to type or tap an item on the screen.,1
Definitely worth the price. Let the geek squad install!,1
This is a great curved glass protector for the new Samsung S8. While I enjoy the protection it offers installing it on the phone proved to be quite a challenge.,1
I like this cover super durable and strong. I would recommend this to my friends.,1
seems to be a good choice to protect the phone screen. Have only had it a short time but so far the phone screen is safe.,1
Grrat warranty and protection. Only complaint is it gets dirty quickly.,1
The glass adds extra protection to the phone. Especially for someone working in the trades.,1
I have had Zagg glass before but this one seems to be too thick. It is hard to push the keys when texting.,1
Reasonable one ! Good one for a transparent protection.,1
Worth every penny. Full protection without sacrificing style.,1
it was so easy to mount I thought I did something wrong. clear and strong,1
The screen is well protected and having the glass be curved made it easy to apply. But the S8 does not have a sensitivity adjustment and the glass will significantly impact the responsive display.,1
Its good protection but starting to lift on bottom and top of phone after less then a week. Dont know if its the product or the person at Best Buys didnt not install it correctly.,1
